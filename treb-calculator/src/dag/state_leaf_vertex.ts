/**
 * second specialization of vertex: this class is for non-cell elements
 * that are dependent on cells: specifically, charts.
 *
 * we want leaf vertices to participate in the normal dirty/calculate
 * cycle, but they don't need to do any calculation other than checking
 * if the underlying data has changed. we should maintain some state so
 * this is a simple check for observers.
 *
 * leaves specifically do not have addresses. we can represent the chart
 * as a calculation, however. (...)
 *
 * FIXME: it might be better to have an intermediate class/interface and
 * have both leaf- and spreadsheet-vertex extend that.
 *
 * UPDATE: we're removing the internal "state" representation because (1)
 * it should be unnecessary, if we are only updating when dependencies
 * change, and (2) it was broken anyway.
 * 
 * Now we rely on the calculation graph to indicate when the leaf is 
 * dirty and needs to update. This will result in extra calculation when
 * you do a hard recalc, but that seems reasonable (and we could possibly
 * work around that).
