/**
 * this is a new cut at array vertices. unlike the old version, we are not
 * trying to reduce the number of vertices (and in fact we won't). this is
 * to handle the case of unbounded arrays (full rows or columns). 
 * 
 * standard behavior with an array is to create all vertices when the reference
 * is created (this is wasteful, but works). this does _not_ work for unbounded
 * arrays because we may add rows/columns later which will expand arrays.
 * 
 * so this class is an intermediate vertex that sits between the dependent edge
 * and all the members of the array. if a new vertex is created later, we check
 * existing arrays to see if anyone will need to add it.
 * 
 * the more arrays you have, the more expensive these checks are (we could 
 * probably optimize this a bit), but it only happens at create time so 
 * potentially it's not too bad -- only on initial create and when manually
 * modifying the spreadsheet. 
 * 
 * [FIXME: that initial create step could definitely be optimized to limit checks]
