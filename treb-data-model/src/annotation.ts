/**
 * new annotation class. annotations are arbitrary content
 * inserted into the sheet, using a floating div element. the
 * class is serialized with the sheet, so the caller can recreate
 * the content if desired.
 *
 * because there's an element of layout involved, callers should
 * interact with annotations through the grid class rather than the
 * sheet.
 * 
 * we are redesigning layout so that instead of a rectangle, in 
 * coordinate space, annotations use extents and offsets in cell space.
 * so layout should now have a TL cell and a BR cell plus offsets for 
 * each. Offset is implemented as a % of the given cell, so offsets are 
 * inverted in the TL/BR cells.
 * 
 * UPDATE: actually while the inverted BR offset makes intuitive sense,
 * it doesn't make technical sense -- easier to always calcluate offsets
 * in the same direction. so offsets are always positive.
 * 
 * we'll leave the old extent in there (for now, at least) to prevent
 * any unintended consequences. 
 *
 * UPDATE: adding a view interface for view-specific data. this is prep
 * for supporting annotations in split views; we have to change how we
 * manage nodes and callbacks.
