/**
 * switching to a different xml library, and trying to simplify how
 * we deal with XLSX files. 
 * 
 * the original impetus for the switch was CSP -- ElementTree uses eval 
 * (actually new Function(...)) which is blocked by CSP, and I don't want to 
 * allow it (or patch ET). so we swtiched to fast-xml-parser, but optimally we 
 * should not be reliant on the actual parser, if we can have some sort of 
 * common data structure.
 * 
 * in any event, in the old scheme we were constantly updating the XML tree
 * so we could write back. in the new scheme, we'll start from raw data, build
 * a structure, and then generate XML from that. 
 * 
 * the primary problems we are going to run into are namespacing and output
 * ordering, but we can probably get through it.
 * 
 * output ordering may be the hardest one, because different browsers. if 
 * necessary we can custom roll the js -> xml side.
